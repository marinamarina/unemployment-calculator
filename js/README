observer.js can be replaced by event emitter or any similar plugin

NOTICE
In the previous version I was initialising model, view(s) and controller in main.js (controller took model and view(s) as an agrument). However I decided to drop it and to initialise controller in main.js, and view(s) + model in controller.

Reason1: otherwise model, controller and view(s) modules are being called twice (first in main.js and then in each other).  

Reason2: this helps to stick to the pattern's rules (view knows only about model, controller about both view and model, model does not know anything about controller or view).

I require only CONTROLLER in the main.js!
